# Get Cultured

In a world with so many distractions and captialist-driven media, true art is being underappreciated and lost to history. So Ultimate Victory Team decided to create a web app that makes timeless, genius masterpieces available at your fingertips, "Get Cultured".
Get Cultured is a web app that lets you search and view famous artworks. Art with keywords matching your search are displayed on cards and more info about each piece pops up when you click on the cards. A history of search is also saved so that you can review them later.
Eventually, using this app, you end up doing exactly as the name suggest.

## User Story
As a user I want to search for famous artworks by Artist’s name, Painting-title, Culture or Period.

- When I enter a search term into the search bar, 
- Then I will be taken to a results page displaying cards with the images and titles of art relating to my search.
- When I click on a card, 
- Then a modal will pop-up with a larger image and extra information on the selected art piece which includes “title”, “period”, “department” ,“date painted", "culture” and “medium”.
- When I click on the home button, 
- Then I am presented with a button list of my previous searches. 


## Technologies Used
- **Tailwind** is a *CSS Framework* and was used to style this webpage.   
- **jQuery** was used to streamline the javascript.   
- The **Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection** API with the fetch method in JavaScript was used to request to the server and load for the detailed information of art collection.
